# Project Outline

This course is a prerequisite for the DNS CLI project...

A CLI and an API have a lot in common.

We can re-use 90% of the code we write in both CLI and API contexts.

In this course, we can use Blink Labs VPN as an example project. We will see how it used for both API and CLI functionality.
